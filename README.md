# Python_Search_Engine
A simple command line search engine, created using python. Run poodle.py !

In this search engine, you provide a seed url and create a database. This procedure involves crawling the website, scraping the pages to create an index, and then ranking them.

poodle.py is the command line application

ignore.txt removes any words you enter from the web scraping operation

Additional .txt files are used by the application for storing the databases you create (the index/rank/url data structures)
